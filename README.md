# Enrollment Management System (EMS) with Trend Analysis by Department using XGBoost

## ABSTRACT
This thesis presents the development and implementation of an **Enrollment Management System (EMS)** with **Trend Analysis by Department**, utilizing the **XGBoost** algorithm, for **Westbridge Institute of Technology, Inc. (WITI)**. The study aims to enhance existing enrollment procedures by addressing areas where manual processes may benefit from improved efficiency, accuracy, and data-driven support. 

The proposed EMS streamlines core administrative workflows—including student registration, payment verification, grade viewing, and enrollment evaluation—while incorporating predictive analytics to forecast enrollment trends and support academic program assessment. By leveraging the XGBoost machine learning algorithm, the system analyzes historical enrollment data to provide timely and actionable insights for institutional planning and strategic decision-making.

System performance was assessed using **ISO/IEC 25010** software quality standards, with user feedback indicating high levels of satisfaction in terms of functionality, reliability, and usability. The results suggest that the system contributes to reducing administrative workload, improving data accuracy, and strengthening the foundation for proactive and informed institutional decisions. The study highlights the value of integrating intelligent automation with responsible human oversight to support the evolving needs of educational institutions.
